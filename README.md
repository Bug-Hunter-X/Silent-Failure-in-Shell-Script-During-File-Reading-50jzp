# Silent Failure in Shell Script During File Reading

This repository demonstrates a common but subtle error in shell scripting: silently failing when encountering errors during file reading.  The script attempts to read a file, but if the file is not found or inaccessible, it fails without reporting an error, potentially leading to unexpected or incorrect results.

The `bug.sh` file contains the erroneous script. The `bugSolution.sh` file provides a corrected version that handles file reading errors gracefully.

This is a common issue when dealing with external resources in shell scripts. Robust error handling is essential to prevent unexpected failures and maintain program stability.
